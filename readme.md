## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python to extract results from a specific website. The code extracts data from a series of web pages and saves the extracted information in an Excel file.

The script utilizes the following libraries:

- `requests` for making HTTP requests to the website
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content
- `pandas` for manipulating and analyzing the extracted data

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Python script in your preferred editor.

2. Modify the `base_url` variable to match the desired website URL.

   ```python
   base_url = 'https://result1.fbise.edu.pk/STATIC_PAGES_SSC_23A/'
   ```

3. Adjust the `range` in the `for` loop to specify the desired range of roll numbers.

   ```python
   for roll_no in range(9806581, 9806617):
       # Rest of the code...
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

5. The extracted data will be saved in an Excel file named `output.xlsx`.
